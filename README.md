## 💡 Vision

To create a cozy digital space that helps people slow down, reflect, and feel more in control of their day-to-day emotions.

## Future Ideas

## 🌱 1. A Garden That Grows With You

Every time users journal or complete an activity, a virtual plant/tree grows on their dashboard.

- Water = journaling

- Sunshine = cozy content read

- Fertilizer = completed reflection prompts 🪴 Peaceful visuals = strong emotional attachment.

## 📚 2. Cozy Story Series

Publish short, fictional cozy stories or journal-style character entries.

- E.g., “The Diary of a Bookstore Cat”

- One tiny episode every few days.

- Think Studio Ghibli vibes. 🌸

Let users subscribe to follow the story.

## 3. Whisper Jar

Users can opt in to either make their entry public or private. Private entries are not visible to other users.

- When reader clicks on the jar then a random whisper from the jar (out of list of public entries) appears.
- The authors details are protected and cannot be seen.
